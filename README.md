# tm_watcher
This repo was a first draft of something I worked on personally to monitor Mac Back ups remotely. I eventually cloned this project into a company's repo and continued from there.

The final version of this project contained an Node.js SQL backend instead of the "server" file written here. The client side was also eventually expanded to include a GUI and additional monitoring functionatlity.

This Repo was made public for demonstration of my python coding ability only, and is not intended to be deployed in any production environment. I assume no liability for this project.
